The PDF file to be graded is called ps6_compphys.pdf. The original plots are in the Plots folder to view them seperately from the PDF (you will have to use the 'open image in new tab option' to view the plots as they have a large dpi).

Note: For some reason on my end GitHub doesn't load the PDF on the site past question 5)e). If this is the case for you as well please download the PDF as it contains my solutions for those unloaded pages.
